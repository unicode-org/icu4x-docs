Its attributes are: `model`: name of the model `dic`: the grapheme cluster dictionary used to train the model `mat1`: the matrix associateed with embedding layer `mat2` - `mat4`: the matrices associated with forward LSTM layer (embedding to hunits, hunits to hunits, and bias respectively) `mat5` - `mat7`: the matrices associated with backward LSTM layer (embedding to hunits, hunits to hunits, and bias respectively) `mat8` - `mat9`: the matrices associated with output layer (weight and bias term respectiely)"]]});
